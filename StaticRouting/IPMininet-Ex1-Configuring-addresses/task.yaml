    This exercise aims to teach you the basic network configuration commands in a virtual network simulated by IPMininet. It uses a ssh session that you can start by directly clicking the "Submit" button and by following the instructions. When you are done entering your Mininet commands, you can write the ``exit`` command to close the session and the exercice will end. For this exercice you will have to configure IP addresses. We will consider the following network topology :

    .. image:: IPMininet-Ex1-Configuring-addresses/topology.png

    The command to configure an address is : ``<node> ip -<version> addr add <address>/<prefixlen> dev <interface>``. Configure the IP addresses of h1 and h2 so that the two hosts can reach each other. The addresses that you must use will be showed during the ssh session in the terminal. The interfaces names can be found with the ``links`` command.
