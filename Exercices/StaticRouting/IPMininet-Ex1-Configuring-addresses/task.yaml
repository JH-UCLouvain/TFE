    This exercise aims to teach you the basic network configuration commands in a virtual network simulated by IPMininet. It uses a ssh session that you can start by directly clicking the "Submit" button and by following the instructions. When you are done entering your Mininet commands, you can write the ``exit`` command to close the session and the exercice will end. For this exercice you will have to configure IP addresses. We will consider the following network topology :

    The command to configure an address is : ``<node> ip -<version> addr add <address>/<prefixlen> dev <interface>``. First you will configure an IPv6 address on the interface ``h1-eth0`` of host ``h1``. To apply this, enter the command ``h1 ip -6 addr add <address>/<prefixlen> dev h1-eth0``. The address that you must use can be revealed by entering our custom command ``getaddress`` during the ssh session and we will use a ``/64`` subnet. Then you will configure in the same way the interface ``h2-eth0`` of host ``h2``.
