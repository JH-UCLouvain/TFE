context: This exercise aims to teach you the basic network configuration commands
    in a virtual network simulated by IPMininet. It uses a ssh session that you can
    start by directly clicking the "Submit" button and by following the instructions.
    When you are done entering your Mininet commands, you can write the ``exit`` command
    to close the session and the exercice will end. For this exercice you will have
    to configure the network using the static routing methodology. This time you will
    not have the topology of the network. You have to find it by yourself with the
    Mininet commands. Some static route(s) are incorrect or missing in this network
    (you can verify it with a ``pingall``). Configure the network routes so that each
    host can reach the other hosts. The addresses are already configured.
