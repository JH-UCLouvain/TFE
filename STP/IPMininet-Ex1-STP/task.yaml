    This exercise aims to teach you the basic network commands in a virtual network simulated by IPMininet. It uses a ssh session that you can start by directly clicking the "Submit" button and by following the instructions. When you are done entering your Mininet commands, you can write the ``exit`` command to close the session and the exercice will end. For this exercice you will have to find informations about a LAN network.

    First, you can identify the switches and the links between them by using ``nodes`` and ``links``. After that, try to find all blocking ports. For that, you can use the ``bridge`` command (https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/bridge.8.html). You can give your answer by typing the custom command ``answer`` followed by the names of the blocking interfaces separated by a comma (for example ``answer s1-eth1,s2-eth3``). If there is no blocking port, you can just enter ``answer none``.
