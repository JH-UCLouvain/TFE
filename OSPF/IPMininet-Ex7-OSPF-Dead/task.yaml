    This exercise aims to teach you the basic network configuration commands in a virtual network simulated by IPMininet. It uses a ssh session that you can start by directly clicking the "Submit" button and by following the instructions. When you are done entering your Mininet commands, you can write the ``exit`` command to close the session and the exercice will end. For this exercice you will have to configure OSPF dead intervals. We will consider the following network topology :

    .. image:: IPMininet-Ex7-OSPF-Dead/topology.png

    On an interface, the dead interval is the number of seconds it takes before the neighbors are considering the router as down. Configure the dead intervals of the two interfaces to 7 seconds. We invite you to check the FRRouting documentation (https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/) to find the commands needed (section OSPFv2 for IPv4 or section OSPFv3 for IPv6).
