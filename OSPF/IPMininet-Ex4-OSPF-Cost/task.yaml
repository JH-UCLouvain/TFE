    This exercise aims to teach you the basic network configuration commands in a virtual network simulated by IPMininet. It uses a ssh session that you can start by directly clicking the "Submit" button and by following the instructions. When you are done entering your Mininet commands, you can write the ``exit`` command to close the session and the exercice will end. For this exercice you will have to configure OSPF costs. We will consider the following network topology :

    .. image:: IPMininet-Ex4-OSPF-Cost/topology.png

    Configure the interfaces costs so that the packets from r1 to r6 follow the path r1-r4-r5-r2-r3-r6.
