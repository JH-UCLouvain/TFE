    This exercise aims to teach you the basic network configuration commands in a virtual network simulated by IPMininet. It uses a ssh session that you can start by directly clicking the "Submit" button and by following the instructions. When you are done entering your Mininet commands, you can write the ``exit`` command to close the session and the exercice will end. For this exercice you will have to configure OSPF costs. We will consider the following network topology :

    .. image:: IPMininet-Ex3-OSPF-Cost/topology.png

    The OSPF protocol uses the costs of the interfaces to compute the shortests paths. These cost can be configured by this way:

    .. code-block:: console

        mininet> r1 vtysh

        router# configure terminal
        router(config)# interface r1-eth0
        router(config-if)# ipv6 ospf6 cost 10
        router(config-if)# exit
        router(config)# exit
        router# write memory
        Building Configuration...
        Configuration saved to /tmp/zebra_r4.cfg
        Configuration saved to /tmp/ospfd_r4.cfg
        Configuration saved to /tmp/ospf6d_r4.cfg
        router# exit
        mininet> 

    In this example, the cost to exit through the interface r1-eth0 is set to 10 with the command ``ip ospf cost <cost>`` (``ipv6 ospf6 cost <cost>`` for IPv6) in the interface section. For this exercices, look for the interfaces names and 
    configure the interfaces of r1 and r4 so that the packets from r1 to r4 follow the path r1-r2-r3-r4 and inversely, the packets from r4 to r1 must follow the path r4-r3-r2-r1.
