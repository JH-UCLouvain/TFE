    This exercise aims to teach you the basic network configuration commands in a virtual network simulated by IPMininet. It uses a ssh session that you can start by directly clicking the "Submit" button and by following the instructions. When you are done entering your Mininet commands, you can write the ``exit`` command to close the session and the exercice will end. For this exercice you will have to configure OSPF hello intervals. We will consider the following network topology :

    .. image:: IPMininet-Ex6-OSPF-Hello/topology.png

    On an interface, the hello interval is the number of seconds separating the sending of two hello messages. Configure the hello intervals of the two interfaces to 7 seconds. We invite you to check the FRRouting documentation (https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/) to find the commands needed (section OSPFv2 for IPv4 or section OSPFv3 for IPv6).
