    This exercise aims to teach you the basic network configuration commands in a virtual network simulated by IPMininet. It uses a ssh session that you can start by directly clicking the "Submit" button and by following the instructions. When you are done entering your Mininet commands, you can write the ``exit`` command to close the session and the exercice will end. For this exercice you will have to configure unnumbered interfaces. We will consider the following network topology :

    Unnumbered interfaces are interfaces that can use the IP address from an other interface of the router (typically the loopback interface). It is mainly used to save some public IP addresses, to reduce the OSPF databases size and to make the shortests paths computing more efficient.
    Configure the addresses of the physical interfaces with the addresses of the loopback interfaces and then, configure the interfaces to be unnumbered. For that you have to enable the "point-to-point" mode on each interface. We invite you to check the FRRouting documentation (https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/) to find the commands needed (section OSPFv2 for IPv4 or section OSPFv3 for IPv6).
