    This exercise aims to teach you the basic network configuration commands in a virtual network simulated by IPMininet. It uses a ssh session that you can start by directly clicking the "Submit" button and by following the instructions. When you are done entering your Mininet commands, you can write the ``exit`` command to close the session and the exercice will end. For this exercice you will have to enable OSPF on the routers. We will consider the following network topology :

    .. image:: IPMininet-Ex1-Enable-OSPF/topology.png

    OSPF is a dynamic protocol that automatically build the routing tables of the devices based on the link-state packets exchanged. To configure OSPF we need the FRRouting protocol suite that can be used here through the VTYSH command interface.

    Here is an example of an OSPF configuration in a router with VTYSH:

    .. code-block:: console

        mininet> r1 vtysh

        Hello, this is FRRouting (version 7.5).

        router# configure terminal
        router(config)# router ospf
        router(config-router)# network 10.0.0.0/16 area 0.0.0.0
        router(config-router)# exit
        router(config)# exit
        router# write memory
        Building Configuration...
        Configuration saved to /tmp/zebra_r3.cfg
        Configuration saved to /tmp/ospfd_r3.cfg
        Configuration saved to /tmp/ospf6d_r3.cfg
        router# exit
        mininet>

    You can enter in a FRR environnement of a node by using the ``<node> vtysh`` command. After that you can enter your configuration commands, do a ``write memory`` command to save you configuration and then execute an ``exit`` command to return on the main IPMininet client (and eventually repeating that for other nodes).
    It's also possible to directly execute a FRR command without entering in the VTYSH client with the ``-c`` argument (e.g. ``r1 vtysh -c '<cmd>'``) or execute multiple commands one after the other with a single line command : ``r1 vtysh -c '<cmd1>' -c '<cmd2>' -c '<cmd3>'...``.
    For this exercice you have to enable OSPF for every interfaces of every routers so that OSPF is activated everywhere and everyone can reach the others. For that, we invite you to check the FRRouting documentation (https://docs.frrouting.org/en/latest/) to find the commands needed (section OSPFv2 for IPv4 or section OSPFv3 for IPv6).
    We will use ``0.0.0.0`` as area address. The ``show running-config`` command could be useful to check the current configurations enabled on a device. If you want to remove a configuration you can use the ``no`` prefix in front of the configuration command (e.g. ``no network ...``). The IP addresses and the interfaces names are randomly generated.
