    This exercise aims to teach you the basic network configuration commands in a virtual network simulated by IPMininet. It uses a ssh session that you can start by directly clicking the "Submit" button and by following the instructions. When you are done entering your Mininet commands, you can write the ``exit`` command to close the session and the exercice will end. For this exercice you will have to configure loopback interfaces. We will consider the following network topology :

    .. image:: IPMininet-Ex6-OSPF-Loopback/topology.png

    Configure the loopback interface of each router from this network. Here, the loopback interfaces have not been anounced to OSPF yet, you also have to do it by yourself so that each router can reach the others with the loopback addresses. The addresses that you must use will be provided with the ``getinstructions`` command.
