    This exercise aims to teach you the basic network configuration commands in a virtual network simulated by IPMininet. It uses a ssh session that you can start by directly clicking the "Submit" button and by following the instructions. When you are done entering your Mininet commands, you can write the ``exit`` command to close the session and the exercice will end. For this exercice you will have to enable OSPF6 on the IPv6 routers. We will consider the following network topology :

    .. image:: IPMininet-Ex2-Enable-OSPF6/topology.png

    This time the routers are using IPv6 addresses, therefore we will use OSPF6. Here is an example of the OSPF6 activation in an IPv6 router with VTYSH:

    .. code-block:: console

        mininet> r1 vtysh

        Hello, this is FRRouting (version 7.5).

    The main difference with IPv6 compared to IPv4 is that you have to perform the configuration for each interface. Look for the interfaces names and configure ospf6 on them so that every routers can communicate with the others. Again you can use 0.0.0.0 for the area.
