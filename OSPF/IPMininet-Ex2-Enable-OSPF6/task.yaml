    This exercise aims to teach you the basic network configuration commands in a virtual network simulated by IPMininet. It uses a ssh session that you can start by directly clicking the "Submit" button and by following the instructions. When you are done entering your Mininet commands, you can write the ``exit`` command to close the session and the exercice will end. For this exercice you will have to enable OSPF on the routers. We will consider the following network topology :

    OSPF is a dynamic protocol that automatically build the routing tables of the devices based on the link-state packets exchanged. To configure OSPF we need the FRRouting protocol suite that can be used here through the VTYSH command interface. You can enter in a FRR environnement of a node by using the ``<node> vtysh`` command. After that you can enter your configuration commands, do a ``write`` command to save you configuration and then execute an ``exit`` command
    to return on the main IPMininet client (and eventually repeating that for other nodes). It's also possible to directly execute a FRR command without entering in the VTYSH client with the ``-c`` argument (e.g. ``r1 vtysh -c '<cmd>'``) or execute multiple commands one after the other with a single line command : ``r1 vtysh -c '<cmd1>' -c '<cmd2>' -c '<cmd3>'...``.
    To enable OSPF, once in VTYSH, you first have to enter in the configuration mode with the ``configure terminal`` command. Then you have to enter in the OSPF section with ``router ospf`` or ``router ospf6`` for IPv6. After that you have to use the ``network <address>/<mask> area <address>`` command. This one will identify which node interfaces must be included in the OSPF process. For this exercices the routers IPv4 addresses are already configured. Look for them
    and make sure that the address/mask that you will use in the command includes all interfaces. We will use ``0.0.0.0`` as area address. Don't forget the ``exit`` and ``write`` commands. Repeat the process for the 3 routers so that OSPF is activated everywhere and everyone can communicate with the others. The ``show running-config`` command could be useful to check the current configurations enabled on a device. If you want to remove a configuration you can use the
    ``no`` prefix in fornt of the configuration command (e.g. ``no network ...``).
