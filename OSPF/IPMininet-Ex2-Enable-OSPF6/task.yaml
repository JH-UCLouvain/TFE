    This exercise aims to teach you the basic network configuration commands in a virtual network simulated by IPMininet. It uses a ssh session that you can start by directly clicking the "Submit" button and by following the instructions. When you are done entering your Mininet commands, you can write the ``exit`` command to close the session and the exercice will end. For this exercice you will have to enable OSPF6 on the IPv6 routers. We will consider the following network topology :

    .. image:: IPMininet-Ex2-Enable-OSPF6/topology.png

    This time the routers are using IPv6 addresses, therefore we will use OSPF6. Here is an example of the OSPF6 activation in an IPv6 router with VTYSH:

    .. code-block:: console

        mininet> r1 vtysh

    The main difference with IPv6 compared to IPv4 is that you have to perform the configuration with ``interface`` instead of ``network`` for each interface. Look for the interfaces names and configure OSPF6 on them so that every routers can communicate with the others. Again you can use 0.0.0.0 for the area.
